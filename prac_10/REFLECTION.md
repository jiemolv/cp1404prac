Practical Task Estimates
Throughout the subject, I found that my estimates for practical tasks were generally accurate, but often underestimated the amount of time required. However, as the subject progressed, I became more aware of my pace and the amount of work required, which helped me improve the accuracy of my estimates.

Code Reviews
Being reviewed and reviewing code has been a valuable learning experience. From being reviewed, I have learned to be more mindful of code readability and structure, as well as the importance of commenting and documentation. In doing reviews, I have learned to be more thorough in my analysis of code and to provide constructive feedback that helps the author improve their code.

Practical Tasks Overall
Overall, I think the practical tasks were well-designed and provided a good mix of challenges. However, if I were in charge of the subject, I would consider providing more opportunities for pair programming and group collaboration, as this can help students learn from each other and build teamwork skills.
